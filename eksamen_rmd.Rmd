### Data cleaning
```{r}

### EDA 
```{r}


#Subset of SB-Winners
sb_winners <- standings[ which(standings$sb_winner=="Won Superbowl"), ]


#Barplot of wins in regular season by the SB-winner 2000-2019

### Wordcloud
```{r}
#Dataset of only winners of games

library(RColorBrewer)         
library(wordcloud)  

game_winners <- games["winners"] %>% 
  group_by(winners) %>% #grouping each word so that we can count number of times the word appears below
  mutate(total_wins = n()) %>% #counting number of times the word appears
  ungroup() %>% #ungrouping the words again
  count(winners, sort = TRUE)

wordcloud(words = game_winners$winners, freq = game_winners$n, min.freq = 0,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.3, 
          colors=brewer.pal(9, "GnBu")[3:9], scale=c(3,.5))
```




### Prediction models
```{r}
set.seed(356)
```



## Naive Bayes
```{r}
model_nb <- train(games_train[, 3:11], games_train[, 2], method = 'naive_bayes')  #preProcess=c("center", "scale") 
predictions_nb <- predict(object = model_nb, games_test[,3:11])

# Confusion matrix 
confusionMatrix(predictions_nb, games_test[,2], positive = "1")

varimp_nb <- varImp(model_nb)
plot(varimp_nb, main="Variable Importance with naive bayes classifier")
```



## SVM (Support Vector Machine)
```{r}


model_svm<- train(games_train[, 3:11], games_train[, 2], method = 'svmLinear',preProcess=c("BoxCox")) #preProcess=c("center", "scale")
predictions_svm <- predict(object = model_svm, games_test[,3:11])

# Confusion matrix 
confusionMatrix(predictions_svm, games_test[,2], positive = "1")

varimp_svm <- varImp(model_svm)
plot(varimp_svm, main="Variable Importance with support vector machine classifier")



```

## K-nearest neighbour
```{r}


```

## Random forest
```{r}


```
